# classy-focus.js

Ever wanted to have separate CSS-styling for browsers focus-indicator outlines, upon mouse and keyboard input?

- classy-focus.js does that.

- Enables accessible styling of the browser focus-rectangle:

    * On mouse or keyboard input, toggles CSS-classes.

    * By default, toggles between *.classy-focus-mouse* and *.classy-focus-keyboard* CSS-classes, on *body* -element.

- Should work on any browser with javascript support, post-2008.

- Based on (http://github.com/lindsayevans/outline.js)
